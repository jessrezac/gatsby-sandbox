At first, the recommendations weren’t included in show notes at all, and now that they are, there isn’t much that Vox does to compile them. I think in the history of the show, they’ve made one list of book recommendations and it was very early on.</p>\n<p>When I considered how I would want Podcast Book Club to work, I knew that I would want it to help me (and any users) see the books recommended by guests and be able to interact with the complete book list by author or genre.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>Beginning in January of this year, books are listed with Amazon links, so it’s fairly easy to find those links in the show notes using Nokogiri. I also wanted to be able to find books in the show notes using Reg Ex and patterns in how books are listed. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to accomplish the second thing, so I started by building a scraper.</p>\n<p>I was mostly successful at building the scraper that looks for books that do not have links so that code exists in my application, but it’s not available as a menu option in the interface quite yet. I didn’t want to complicate the usability of my app and jeopardize my success in the assignment, so I will leave that as an extended functionality on a later version of the app.</p>\n<p>After I built the scraper, I created objects to store scraped data. The objects in my app are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Episodes</li>\n<li>Books</li>\n<li>Authors</li>\n<li>Genres</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also have a CLI object that creates an instance of the interface for the app and a Scraper object that creates an instance of the scraper that the CLI and other objects use to build data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Although the links in the episodes are from Amazon, I use a GoogleBooks gem to find information about the books beyond what is provided in show notes. I made this choice very early on as I found that Amazon’s redirect loops tripped Nokogiri when it isn’t starting its scrape on one Amazon.com URL. GoogleBooks also helps with scaling the functionality to include books that aren’t linked to Amazon. My scraper builds a query for each book that includes its best guess for the title and author from show notes and then searches Google Books using that query and uses the first result to build a book, author, and genre object for the book.</p>\n<p>I use player.fm as the site to scrape to get information about the Ezra Klein Show. I initially chose it because it seemed to list every episode rather than relying on javascript and a “load more” button as the user reaches the end of a partial list. As I got a little deeper into my code, I realized that the page was actually using javascript to create a continuous scroll of the episodes. As the user wasn’t required to click, I looked for the URL that javascript called and built my own path that requests the number of episodes that have books listed at all and then adds to them based on an algorithm that adds to the number every time a new episode should be released on Monday or Thursday.</p>\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\n<p>The main lesson I learned was how to scale a project correctly for the assignment and I’ve learned a lot about the process of building an app. Overall, I like the Flatiron School curriculum a lot, but on this (major!) project, I feel like I would have benefited from a checklist that explained the process of watching the code. They provided one video of a simple CLI app development process, but I learn better from text.</p>\n<p>On future projects, I’ll follow a much better project checklist that will help me include envisioning my app, sketching an interface, coding it using pseudocode and then stubbing, and then building it in a more linear way.</p>\n<p>I did attempt to incorporate tests in this app even though it wasn’t part of the project assignment. It helped a lot with coding the object classes and making sure they related to each other correctly, but because I was writing the app without a ton of planning of how this would happen, I ultimately changed the way that Genre’s instantiated and that caused many of my tests to break by the end of app development.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>I hope to return to the development of this app so that I can include more functions.</p>\n<p>First, I would like the app to be able to generate Books based on episodes that do not have links in the show notes. Currently, this works most but not all of the time.</p>\n<p>Second, I would like to give more options after books are listed. It would be cool if the user could use a command to open the URL in their browser without leaving their keyboard. And I’d like users to be able to show a synopsis of certain books in the genre list and author list. Possibly, I would want to remove the synopsis from the book list unless the user requested it.</p>\n<p>Third, I would like to consider using the Goodreads API instead of GoogleBooks. Practically, Google Books is very forgiving which helps when the query generated from show notes that do not have links are not exact, but I would like to be able to let users save a book to their want-to-read list on Goodreads.</p>\n<h2>More</h2>\n<p>Listen to The Ezra Klein Show at <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/the-ezra-klein-show/\">Player.fm</a> or check out other <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/podcasts\">Vox Media Podcasts</a>.</p>\n<p>Checkout <a href=\"https://github.com/jessrezac/podcast-book-club\">Podcast Book Club on Github</a>.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/podcast-book-club/"}}},{"node":{"id":"7515cd31-0190-5b43-9ae2-ba4a44b9323b","excerpt":"Card Trick is a web application written in Ruby on Rails that creates clean and simple flash cards, automatically, using comments in Google…","frontmatter":{"author":"Jess Rezac","date":"November 14th, 2019","title":"Card Trick","github_url":"https://github.com/jessrezac/card-trick","demo_url":null,"skills":[{"id":"Ruby","icon":"gem","icon_prefix":"fas"},{"id":"Javascript","icon":"js","icon_prefix":"fab"},{"id":"HTML","icon":"html5","icon_prefix":"fab"},{"id":"CSS","icon":"css3-alt","icon_prefix":"fab"}],"kicker":"Card Trick creates clean and simple flashcards, automatically, from Google Docs.

The idea for this project came from my husband, Kyle Rezac-Dennis who was completing a UX certification, studying flashcard apps. In his research with current undergraduates, law students, and med school applicants who had recently studied for the MCAT, he learned that while there are some flash card apps that are good, students don’t like creating their own flash cards when they have already spent a lot of time working on notes and outlines for their courses. As we discussed the project, I realized the Google Drive API would allow someone to access highlighted text and comments in a Google Doc which could then be generated into a flashcard.</p>\n<h2>Planning</h2>\n<p>I felt like my Sinatra project would have improved with more planning of views before I started developing the app. I spent more time before this app planning views. I also made a plan for the order that I would use to create features. My main strategy was to tackle as much of the code as I could before I integrated Omniauth or the Google Drive API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Using the Google Drive API was the biggest challenge in this project. In May, Google limited the access that third-party apps could have to Google Drive files without going through a verification process with Google. My original vision of the app would have had users authorize my app to have access to their Google Drive when they logged in with Omniauth or the first time they wanted to create a stack through Google Drive. I thought I would provide them a dropdown of their Google Docs to generate a stack of flashcards. Instead, users have to authorize my app one time per file.</p>\n<p>To select a file, they need to use the Google Picker to select a file from their drive. This requires my app to access an additional API. Also, the Picker API uses javascript, not Ruby, to function. It was challenging to use Javascript at a higher level than I have before, but I managed to figure it out and feed it to my app’s back end to create stacks of flashcards. Ultimately, I think this improves the usability of my app because it means that users aren’t tied to the account they use to login to generate flashcards and can instead use a personal Gmail account to login while generating flashcards from a school G Suite account.</p>\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\n<p>I was very sick the last two days of this project period — including right now — so I’m wishing I would have been able to allocate more time to the project earlier in the project cycle.</p>\n<p>In part because of the illness, I haven’t been able to spend much time learning Devise or Pundit, so I look forward to abstracting authentication and authorization out of my next app.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/card-trick/"}}},{"node":{"id":"f9111498-cc0c-5d0b-ae73-0f5f10026475","excerpt":"Lemonade Stand is a clone of the classic Apple IIE game of the same name.

It’s a single page application, built using Javascript’s <code>fetch</code> command to asynchronously communicate with an API built in Ruby on Rails.</p>\n<h2>Planning</h2>\n<p>I planned for this project by playing the original game available through online emulators several times. I read a strategy guide for a more sophisticated version of Lemonade Stand that discussed ways to optimize your game inputs based on the randomized weather. I also found a git repository of the code for the original game in BASIC and read through it to get an idea of how to generate the logic for the game.</p>\n<p>I designed my back-end to comply with the project requirements. I decided to persist individual Games and Days to the API so that in future versions of the game, there could be a high score leaderboard that players could add their name to and so I could aggregate data to increase difficulty based on results that players had saved.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>This project was pretty straightforward. I struggled a little bit with using Netflix’s Fast JSON Api gem to serialize API data. My introduction to the gem had proposed including the collection of objects in a has_many relationship on the parent by passing options to include that collection to the new instance of the serializer. I had better results including :days as an attribute in the Games serializer and then specifiying which serializer the gem should use when including the day attributes.</p>\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\n<p>This project helped me grasp the specifics of object-oriented programming in Javascript.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/lemonade-stand/"}}},{"node":{"id":"1d649d95-4c14-5d41-a0f9-5a51e6201c1f","excerpt":"Daily Practice is a journal that allows a user to keep a private daily journalling practice that includes free-writing, gratitude…","frontmatter":{"author":"Jess Rezac","date":"September 12th, 2019","title":"Daily Practice","github_url":"https://github.com/jessrezac/daily-practice","demo_url":"https://www.loom.com/share/cdc6cdebfb7f4fd79a302ed9f2084cbc","skills":[{"id":"Ruby","icon":"gem","icon_prefix":"fas"},{"id":"HTML","icon":"html5","icon_prefix":"fab"},{"id":"CSS","icon":"css3-alt","icon_prefix":"fab"}],"kicker":"Daily Practice is a private journal for free-writing and keeping a daily gratitude, forgiveness and commitment practice.

The idea was inspired by a <a href=\"https://shamelesspopery.com\">Catholic friend</a> who described a daily prayer practice where one says thank you to God for three things, asks Jesus for forgiveness for two things, and makes one commitment to the Holy Spirit. I liked the idea, thought the practice would be useful, and knew the resulting application would satisfy — and go just beyond — the project requirements of the Sinatra project at Flatiron School.</p>\n<h2>Planning</h2>\n<p>I began this project by illustrating a database schema that showed the relationship between the User and their Journals. Then, I loosely sketched a user interface for the main views I would need. I considered writing this blog post that describes the project as a kind of planning exercise. I still feel like that idea would be useful, but for this project, I started by creating a checklist of the order I planned to employ when writing code.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>After setting up the file directory, <code>config.ru</code> and <code>config/environment.rb</code>, I began by creating ActiveRecord migrations to build the database. I created Users and Journals with database tables and ruby classes that assigned relationships between them.</p>\n<p>Next, I worked on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session Controller and views</li>\n<li>Journal Controller and views</li>\n<li>Gratitude database migration and models with edits to account for Gratitude in Journal controller and views</li>\n<li>Forgiveness database migration and models with edits to Journal controller and views</li>\n<li>Commitment database migration and models with edits to Journal controller and views</li>\n<li>I worked on the user interface in Views</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Overall, this project didn’t feel very challenging. After my CLI project, I wanted to stay within the framework of the assignment a little better — for my own stress level — and I definitely did that this time. I’m glad that I included a has many through relationship in my models, because without the little bit of extra thinking that component required I would have been very bored.</p>\n<p>I wish I would have done more to sketch out the UI from the outset of the project. I spent entirely too much time working on views and overhauled the entire design in some respects about two and a half times. I think I would have been less frustrated if I would have had a better wireframe of where I wanted the design to end up.</p>\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\n<p>I spent a lot of time learning Bootstrap 4 and brushing up on my CSS3 and HTML5 skills during this project. With more than 15 years of experience in HTML and CSS, I have gotten a little reliant on Wordpress and plugins in my front-end work, so I’m glad to feel like my technical knowledge is up to date in that area.</p>\n<p>While familiarizing myself with Bootstrap 4, I determined that the most straightforward way to customize it was using Sass, and I found picking up that framework to also be very fulfilling.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>I designed this program in a secular way, but my hope for it is that it would be designed to be useful to people who are coming from a religious tradition as well. I envision letting users choose whether they come from a Christian tradition, Buddhist tradition, or prefer for their Daily Practice to remain secular. These options would reword the prompts for each section of the Daily Practice journal — where Christians would ask for forgiveness instead of the more bi-directional prompt “What needs forgiveness today?”</p>\n<p>I’d also like to add Christian, Buddhist, and secular inspiration for people that changes daily. I’ve already determined that could be scraped from two sites I found, but it needs to be built.</p>\n<p>Next, I want users to be able to design their Daily Practice journal in a modular way. For example, a user could decide to only free-write and record a commitment.</p>\n<p>Then, I would like to let users add <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/todo.html\">Paul Graham’s daily to-do list reminders</a> to the commitment section of their journal. I discovered these during the project and thought they would fit well.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have some ideas for UI changes. I’d like to be able to use contenteditable HTML elements instead of textareas for the sake of aesthetics, but I’ll need Javascript to accomplish it. I think using the Unsplash API — in the style of <a href=\"https://momentumdash.com/\">Momentum Dash</a>— to add more decorative graphics to the journal would be a nice touch, too.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/daily-practice/"}}},{"node":{"id":"e1c1e008-103e-54dc-9590-c3f6ef73bc21","excerpt":"Bout Manager is essentially a competition management platform built for the Louder Than A Bomb poetry festival.

Because of my involvement as an organizer of LTAB, I have deep knowledge on the mathematics of the competition and the needs that software could meet.</p>\n<p>Since the festival began in 2014, every bout we’ve ran in Kansas City used my Google Sheet to keep score, and I personally had ran the spreadsheet at least 80% of the time. When a different bout manger ran scoring, they needed to know several specific instructions for the sheet, including that the order teams were listed in for round one needed to be maintained in the spreadsheet through every round even though the teams rotated their order from round to round.</p>\n<p>To set up the Google Sheet for each bout, the bout manager needed to receive a list of the poets for each team. We always had enough to carry on the round, but we often got less complete data than we would have liked. An app could also solve this problem by facilitating team check-in online prior to the bout start or even online. An app could also provide error messages to coaches when their team configuration violated a rule.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 70.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"webmap illustrating database schema\"\n        title=\"Rails Database Schema\"\n        src=\"/static/f1431389752a80a3157efe8783ec48c9/00d43/bout-manager-scapple.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f1431389752a80a3157efe8783ec48c9/63868/bout-manager-scapple.png 250w,\n/static/f1431389752a80a3157efe8783ec48c9/0b533/bout-manager-scapple.png 500w,\n/static/f1431389752a80a3157efe8783ec48c9/00d43/bout-manager-scapple.png 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span>Rails Database Schema Mapped Using Scapple</p>\n<p>To plan for the app, I mapped out a database schema using <a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview\">Scapple</a>. To help predict and think through some of the challenges of building a database that would span multiple teams in multiple competitions across multiple seasons, I relied on the Sports Standards Alliance’s <a href=\"http://www.sportsdb.org/sd\">Open Database Schema for Sports Information</a>. This helped me to structure the database schema so that resources stay connected to each other in relatively small units: I created teams that belong to an organization and a season so that the events and poets affiliated with each organization could be organized under single seasons.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>I worked through a reasonable number of technical challenges in this project, but nothing poses a challenge like a global pandemic.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.199999999999996%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot of Events Index from Bout Manager app\"\n        title=\"Screenshot of Events Index from Bout Manager app\"\n        src=\"/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/00d43/bout-manager-events-index.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/63868/bout-manager-events-index.png 250w,\n/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/0b533/bout-manager-events-index.png 500w,\n/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/00d43/bout-manager-events-index.png 1000w,\n/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/aa440/bout-manager-events-index.png 1500w,\n/static/ab0ee30df6185ab4a49501810cdd6cb9/e8950/bout-manager-events-index.png 2000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span>Screenshot of Events Index</p>\n<p>On the technical side, I solved problems including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authenticating users and authorizing access to the API with webtokens using Devise and Doorkeeper gems</li>\n<li>creating a Redux store that could support my app without storing too much information that could be retrieved from the API</li>\n<li>normalizing data from JSON API to the Redux store as entities</li>\n<li>learning conventions for React app structure and creating my own patterns to rely on when writing functions, naming variables and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the majority of my challenges on this project were more logistical and mental. Our first project week was the week that the school where I work as website/digital media specialist was closing down due to the pandemic. I managed all of our communications related to COVID-19 and our school closure for that week and then cancelled all but one day of vacation the following week that I had planned to dedicate to this app. The app moved slowly and not quite steadily from there. My day job workload about doubled when school moved online, so in the time that I developed this app, I also worked on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>launching 10 website landing pages</li>\n<li>editing 40 videos that were sent as a morning message to every family in our school</li>\n<li>recreating two cherished school traditions in the form of video-rich landing pages</li>\n<li>keeping community alive through a hashtag campaign that meant receiving easily quintuple email volume</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In case you were hoping my personal life was steadier, my family got doxxed mid-summer.</p>\n<h2>Lessons</h2>\n<p>This app was much more complex than any of the React apps we worked with in the React module at Flatiron School. The API was more ambitious than my Rails app, <a href=\"https://rezac.dev/projects/card-trick\">Card Trick</a>, and accessing it as an API added complexity to the project, too.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1000px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 88.8%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Git log for bout manager app\"\n        title=\"Git Commit Messages\"\n        src=\"/static/90cfe7e7fb2defdbe407e53ebc0796d2/00d43/bout-manager-todo-lists.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/90cfe7e7fb2defdbe407e53ebc0796d2/63868/bout-manager-todo-lists.png 250w,\n/static/90cfe7e7fb2defdbe407e53ebc0796d2/0b533/bout-manager-todo-lists.png 500w,\n/static/90cfe7e7fb2defdbe407e53ebc0796d2/00d43/bout-manager-todo-lists.png 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span>Todo lists, notes, planning and git commit messages kept me organized over a long coding project timeline</p>\n<p>I used a lot of productivity tools and habits that have been helpful to me in my professional career to keeping working on this project bit by bit without requiring a lot of mental effort to remember where I left off. My other projects for Flatiron School were created over 2–3 week crunches, so I was rarely out of my code for more than 12 hours until the project was submitted. This app required making better plans, lists, and notes. I wrote <code>git</code> commit messages with enough detail that I could refer back to them when I could jump back into coding. I left comments in code with todo items to keep track of where I would start the next time.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot about structuring a React app and look forward to using that in future projects. I have a better handle on when and how to use Redux. When I return to this project to add more features, I may rely a lot less on Redux and leave more of the work to the API, but regardless of how much this project needs to use Redux to meet project requirements, I understand how to structure a Redux store much better than before I started the project.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","fields":{"slug":"/bout-manager/"}}}]}}}
