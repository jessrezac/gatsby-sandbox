[Social media optimization is an important component of a content marketing strategy](https://rezac.dev/frontend/setting-up-gatsby-for-social-media-optimization/ "Setting Up Gatsby for Social Media Optimization") designed to reach your website's target audience.

Here are some tools I like to create images to appear in social media links to your content:

## Be confident about ideal image sizes with Sprout Social

Social media platforms change their ideal image sizes for linked posts more often than you'd think.

Sprout Social's [Always Up-to-Date Guide to Social Media Image Sizes](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-image-sizes-guide/ "Always Up-to-Date Guide to Social Media Image Sizes") is a helpful bookmark to make sure that the sizes you're using are the best choice.

## Create images from stock photos with Buffer's Pablo

[Pablo, a tool by Buffer](https://pablo.buffer.com "Pablo"), creates correctly sized images easily. It remixes stock images (or your own upload) with text and a contrast filter to make text legible. When you have your design, you can resize it for different platforms. 

## Resize your own images with Landscape by Sprout Social

If you have an image already and don't want or need to overlay text, [Sprout Social's Landscape]() lets you resize images for social media platforms. This offers more sizes than Pablo and can be great if you're resizing for several platforms because it appends a suffix to your file that makes it really easy to find. 

## Generate images automatically with the Open Graph Images Gatsby Plugin

If you're over the headache of it, the [Gatsby plugin Open Graph Images](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-open-graph-images/ "https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-open-graph-images/") will generate an image directly from your React Components.
