Whether you are working on your own portfolio or project or designing something to be client-facing, a goal of a front-end project should be attract the right audience to your website. You can expect people to find your website in one of three ways: 

* Search
* Paid Advertising
* Content Marketing

With a little bit of search engine optimization, you can help your website to have a share of the search results for given terms. If your audience knows your name, search is fairly straight-forward. For example, searching for "Jess Rezac" will help you find me. If your audience can identify that they have the need you solve, some simple SEO (search engine optimization) on your site will help them connect to you.

If you have a budget for it, paid advertising takes you even further. Now, you can make sure you're seen when people search directly for your competitors or that people find you by searching for a solution to a problem they have in a saturated industry. 

This is why SEO/social share optimization is important.
